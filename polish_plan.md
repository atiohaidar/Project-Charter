# Professional Polish Plan

## 1. Visual Enhancements (Texture)
- Add a CSS-based noise/grain texture to the `.doc-page` background to simulate real aged paper, rather than just a flat beige color.

## 2. Layout Enhancements (Footer)
- Add a footer at the bottom of the page (and visible in print).
- Content: `PROJECT CHARTER | CONFIDENTIAL | Printed on [Date]`

## 3. Content Enhancements (Legal)
- Add a **Disclaimer / Agreement Clause** right before the signature block.
- Text: *"This document serves as a formal agreement..."*
- This makes it look like a binding contract, not just a draft.

## 4. Typography
- Force `text-align: justify` on all paragraphs for a neat block look.
- Clean up table alignment in the metadata section.
